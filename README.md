# backend-sample app

This sample application was born from a take home project sent to me during the screening process of my last job. The initial request was to create an API that would return the number of milliseconds between now and tomorrow, yesterday, next week, and next month. 

Initially, the project was `.js` with minimal docker-compose functionality to run the express app. I've updated things for `typescript` transpilation to `.js`, some dev nice-to-haves (`husky` pre-commit hooks and `eslint` linter), `jest` testing, and a `CI/CD` pipeline to run tests and perform deployments to a running public lambda API via my AWS account. It's not perfect but it acts as a proof of concept to show off interdiscinplinary coding skills

## Github CI/CD AWS Deploy ðŸš€
Behind this repo is a live API. Please ask for the URL if I have not passed it to you!

```
curl -X GET $API_URL/next_week
```

## ESLint + Prettier
Why ESLint + Prettier? 

I've taken part in dev teams where code reviews pile up or where individual devs had code-style differences. With ESLint + Prettier the various petty level style differences are done away with (ESLint rules are created by very smart very opiniated devs!). Teams can supress rules or create their own. Additionally, ESLint can detect and flag a variety of bad coding practices (which can be a boon to junior devs in the absence of more senior devs). The overall point is that a computer can perform a part of the review freeing up devs to looks for logical errors or other higher level concerns. In this repo it runs on every commit, blocks the commit if there are errors found, and gives warnings.

## Jest
Why Jest?

With ESLint and prettier enforcing an agreed upon coding style and unit tests proving that regressions aren't introduced/ new features work as intended devs can feel confident in the feature they're presenting and reviewers can have confidence in the quality of the code. Focus can be on how the feature was implemented. Also unit tests are great deliverables for clients to show the code works as intended and helps devs onboarding to a new code base. It's just paying things forward âœ¨

Run

```
docker-compose build
```

Then

```
docker-compose up
```

This should pull up the application with hot swapping from pm2
